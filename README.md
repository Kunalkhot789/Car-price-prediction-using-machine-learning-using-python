Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning in Python

*Project Overview 
-This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict car prices based on various features such as brand, model, year, mileage, engine capacity, fuel type, and other specifications. By analyzing historical car sales data, the model helps buyers and sellers estimate a fair market price for a vehicle, aiding in better decision-making.  

*Key Features  
- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and processes car sales datasets, handling missing values and outliers.  
- Feature Engineering: Identifies key factors influencing car prices, such as depreciation trends and fuel efficiency.  
- Model Training: Implements various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.  
- Performance Evaluation: Assesses model accuracy using RÂ² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).  
- User Interface (Optional): A web or mobile-based interface where users can input car details to get price predictions.  

*Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python  
- Libraries:Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost  
- Dataset: Public car sales data from sources like Kaggle or custom dealership data  

*Project Impact  
This system helps individuals and businesses, including car dealers and insurance companies, make data-driven pricing decisions. It improves transparency in the automotive market, making transactions fairer and more efficient.
